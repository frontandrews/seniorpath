title: Production Failures Without Guessing
description: A calmer way to handle production incidents without turning the investigation into opinion, panic, or random fixes.

## The problem

Production failures create pressure fast.

That pressure often pushes people into the weakest possible behavior: guessing, changing multiple things at once, or defending a theory before the evidence is there.

## Mental model

An incident is not the moment to sound certain.

It is the moment to reduce uncertainty in the right order.

The useful question is:

> What do we know, what do we not know yet, and what signal would reduce the uncertainty the fastest?

## Breaking it down

When something breaks in production, ask:

1. what is the user impact right now?
2. what changed recently?
3. what signal do I have from logs, metrics, or traces?
4. what is the safest next step to narrow the problem?

That keeps the response grounded.

## Simple example

Suppose error rate spikes right after a deploy.

A weak response is to say "the database is probably overloaded" and start changing queries.

A stronger response is to check whether the failures are isolated to one route, one region, one release, or one dependency before touching the system.

The goal is to shrink the space of possible causes first.

## Common mistakes

- changing several things before proving the failure mode
- confusing confidence with speed
- ignoring rollback or mitigation while chasing the perfect root cause immediately
- describing assumptions as facts

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer reduces uncertainty before they optimize:

> I want to protect users first, narrow the failure mode second, and only then decide the right fix.

That usually leads to better judgment under pressure.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can prioritize impact and evidence
- you know how to narrow a failure instead of guessing
- you can balance mitigation with investigation

That signals production maturity, not just debugging enthusiasm.

> Strong incident handling starts with signal, not with a favorite theory.

> If the next step does not reduce uncertainty, it probably is not the best next step.
