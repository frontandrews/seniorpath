title: Async and Race Bugs Without Drama
description: A calmer way to reason about timing bugs without pretending the behavior is random just because it is intermittent.

## The problem

Race bugs are frustrating because the system looks inconsistent.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it fails, and the team starts describing the bug as random even though it is usually very mechanical.

## Mental model

A timing bug is rarely chaos.

It is usually one of these:

- two operations happening in an unsafe order
- shared state being updated without coordination
- an assumption about timing that stopped being true

Once you model the order, the bug gets smaller.

## Breaking it down

When async behavior looks unstable, ask:

1. what are the exact operations competing here?
2. which shared state or side effect do they touch?
3. what order did the code assume?
4. what timing variation would break that assumption?

That moves the investigation from vibes to sequence.

## Simple example

Suppose a search box fires requests on every keystroke and updates UI with the last response that returns.

If an older request returns after a newer one, the UI can show stale results even though every request "worked."

The bug is not random. The update policy is missing a rule about which result is allowed to win.

## Common mistakes

- calling the bug random because it is intermittent
- focusing only on one function instead of the event order
- ignoring shared mutable state
- trying to reproduce forever without writing down the sequence

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer turns the timing into a model:

> I want to know which operations overlap, what state they touch, and what ordering assumption the code made by accident.

That usually reveals the failure faster.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can reason about event order
- you understand how shared state creates timing bugs
- you know how to explain the bug as a sequence instead of a mystery

That is much stronger than saying "race condition" and stopping there.

> Timing bugs get easier when you describe them as order, state, and assumption.

> If you can draw the sequence, you are already close to the fix.
