title: Logs and Observability Without Noise
description: A practical way to instrument systems so the useful signal is easier to find when something actually goes wrong.
summary: Observability helps when it makes diagnosis faster, not when it only creates more data to scroll through.

## The problem

Many systems produce plenty of telemetry and still feel blind when something breaks.

The issue is not always lack of data. It is often lack of useful signal, structure, and correlation.

## Mental model

Observability is not a trophy wall of logs, metrics, and traces.

It is the ability to answer useful questions about the system faster.

If the instrumentation does not make diagnosis easier, it is mostly noise.

## Breaking it down

When instrumenting a system, ask:

1. what question should this signal help answer?
2. what identifiers let me correlate events across the path?
3. what context matters enough to log every time?
4. what volume would create noise instead of clarity?

That keeps observability tied to diagnosis.

## Simple example

Logging "request failed" a thousand times is not very helpful.

Logging request ID, route, tenant, dependency name, status, and latency is much more useful because it lets you connect one failure to the rest of the path.

Good logs reduce interpretation work.

## Common mistakes

- logging everything without deciding what matters
- omitting correlation IDs or request context
- writing logs that state a failure with no surrounding signal
- treating noisy dashboards as proof of observability maturity

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer instruments for questions:

> I want the next person to answer what failed, where it failed, and how wide the impact is without reading the whole system backward.

That standard keeps the telemetry useful.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can separate signal from noise
- you think about correlation and context
- you understand observability as support for diagnosis, not decoration

That sounds much stronger than listing tools.

> Good observability reduces the time between "something is wrong" and "this is the failure mode."

> If the telemetry creates more scrolling than clarity, it is not helping enough yet.
