## The problem

"Node is single-threaded" helps at first and then starts to confuse people.

It is useful only if you mean the main JavaScript execution path. It becomes misleading when someone uses it to describe the entire runtime.

## Mental model

The cleaner split is:

- JavaScript runs on the main thread by default
- the event loop coordinates asynchronous work
- libuv can offload some work
- worker threads or separate processes handle parallel CPU work when needed

That gives you a better answer than a raw yes or no.

## Breaking it down

When someone asks whether Node is single-threaded, try to separate:

1. what runs on the main JavaScript thread
2. what gets coordinated as async I/O
3. what can move to the thread pool
4. when worker threads or processes make more sense

That makes the trade-off visible instead of vague.

## Simple example

```js
app.get('/hash', (req, res) => {
  const result = slowHash(req.query.input)
  res.send(result)
})
```

If `slowHash` is CPU-heavy and runs on the main thread, request handling slows down because the event loop is blocked.

Node is still good at coordinating I/O-heavy work, but CPU-heavy work changes the picture fast.

## Common mistakes

- answering only "yes" or "no" with no nuance
- assuming async automatically means multi-threaded execution
- forgetting the difference between I/O coordination and CPU work
- treating worker threads and processes as the same tool

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer separates the runtime layers before answering:

> JavaScript runs on the main thread by default, but the runtime is not limited to one thing happening overall. The real question is whether the bottleneck is coordination or computation.

That framing is clearer and more useful.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can separate the main thread from the whole runtime
- you understand why CPU-heavy work hurts Node differently from I/O-heavy work
- you know when worker threads become relevant

That shows judgment instead of memorized phrasing.

> Node is not a one-word answer. The useful distinction is main-thread JavaScript versus the rest of the runtime.

> If you can explain what blocks the event loop and what does not, you are already beyond the shallow version.
