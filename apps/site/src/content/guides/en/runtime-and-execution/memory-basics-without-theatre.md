## The problem

Memory often gets taught so abstractly that it feels disconnected from day-to-day code.

But many annoying bugs come from exactly this layer: shared references, objects staying alive too long, or structures growing with no limit.

Without a minimal model, everything starts to sound like "JavaScript got weird."

## Mental model

The useful model does not need to be deep.

Think about it like this:

- simple values are usually cheap to copy
- objects and arrays are usually accessed through references
- memory can only be released when nothing can reach that value anymore

That already helps a lot when you read bugs and strange behavior.

## Breaking it down

When memory is part of the problem, ask:

1. was this value copied or shared by reference?
2. who can still point to this object?
3. should this value still be alive or should it be gone?
4. is any structure growing without a limit?

Those questions are usually more useful than isolated theory.

## Simple example

```js
const user = { name: 'Ana' }
const sameUser = user

sameUser.name = 'Bia'

console.log(user.name)
```

The result is:

```txt
Bia
```

That does not happen because the object was copied badly. It happens because both variables point to the same object.

## Common mistakes

- assuming object assignment creates a copy automatically
- forgetting that shared references spread side effects
- storing data in caches, maps, or lists and never cleaning them up
- talking about the garbage collector as if it solves every accumulation problem alone

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer looks at memory through ownership and reachability:

> The key question is not only where the value was created. It is who can still reach it and for how long it stays alive.

That changes how you debug and how you design structures.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you understand the difference between copy and reference
- you can explain why a value still exists
- you can connect that to real bugs, not just theory

That is much stronger than repeating "stack and heap" with no context.

> Memory gets simpler when you think in references, reachability, and lifetime.

> If you do not know who can still reach the value, it is hard to explain why it did not disappear.
