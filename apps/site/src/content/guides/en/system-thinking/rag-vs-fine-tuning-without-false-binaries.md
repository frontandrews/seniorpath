The weak version of this answer sounds like a tooling preference.

The stronger version sounds like a systems decision.

## Start with the failure mode

If the model mostly fails because it does not have the right context, that points toward retrieval.

If the model has the context but still behaves the wrong way again and again, that points more toward changing the model behavior itself.

That is the first split to make.

## When RAG is the better answer

RAG is usually the better default when:

- the knowledge changes often
- the data is internal or proprietary
- citations or traceability matter
- you want a cheaper control point for iteration

The main advantage is operational.

You can improve retrieval, chunking, ranking, or prompt composition without retraining a model every time the source material changes.

## When fine-tuning starts to pay off

Fine-tuning becomes more attractive when:

- the model keeps failing in the same patterned way
- you need stable output style or workflow behavior
- prompt engineering and retrieval are no longer moving the needle enough

The cost is higher, so the reason needs to be stronger.

## Strong framing

> I choose RAG when the main problem is access to the right knowledge at the right time. I choose fine-tuning when the model behavior itself needs to shift in a repeatable way. Retrieval is usually the faster and more inspectable control point, so I treat it as the default unless the failure pattern proves otherwise.

That answer is short, concrete, and not ideological.
