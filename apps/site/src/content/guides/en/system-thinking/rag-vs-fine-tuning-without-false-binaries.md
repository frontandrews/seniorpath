## The problem

A lot of RAG versus fine-tuning discussions turn into tool tribalism.

It starts sounding like you need to choose a side before you even understand what kind of failure the system has.

That makes the decision ideological instead of technical.

## Mental model

The key split is not the technology label.

It is the failure mode:

- the model does not have the right context at the right time
- the model has context and still behaves badly in the same way

That split already improves the conversation.

## Breaking it down

Before choosing, ask:

1. is the problem missing or stale knowledge?
2. or is the behavior still wrong even with good context?
3. do I need a control point that is easier to update and inspect?
4. is the operational cost of fine-tuning justified here?

Those questions move the decision toward the real system problem.

## Simple example

Imagine an internal assistant that answers questions about company policy.

If it fails because it did not receive the latest document, the problem looks much more like retrieval than fine-tuning.

Now imagine the model receives the right context and still replies in the wrong format or ignores important instructions over and over.

That starts to look more like a behavior problem than a knowledge access problem.

## Common mistakes

- treating RAG and fine-tuning as if one cancels the other
- reaching for fine-tuning too early without proving retrieval is already good
- calling every error a context problem
- ignoring the operational cost of evaluation, iteration, and maintenance

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer starts from the observable failure:

> If the problem is getting the right knowledge at the right time, I want retrieval first. If the problem is repeated behavior even with strong context, then changing the model behavior becomes more relevant.

That keeps the answer grounded.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can separate knowledge access from behavior change
- you understand why retrieval is often the cheaper default
- you know when a repeated behavior problem points past prompt and retrieval tuning

That sounds much stronger than tool preference.

> Retrieval and fine-tuning solve different problems. The failure mode should decide the first move.

> If you cannot name the failure clearly, the architecture choice is still too early.
