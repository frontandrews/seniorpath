title: API and Service Design With Clear Boundaries
description: A simpler way to design system boundaries that stay understandable as the product and team grow.

## The problem

Teams often split systems into APIs and services before they are clear about ownership.

Then the boundaries look organized on paper, but the product logic leaks across services and every change crosses too many lines.

## Mental model

A useful boundary is not one that sounds architectural.

It is one that makes ownership, contracts, and change easier to understand.

The better question is:

> What should this service own so the rest of the system depends on it cleanly?

## Breaking it down

When designing a boundary, ask:

1. what domain or capability does this service truly own?
2. what data or invariants should stay behind that boundary?
3. what contract do other systems need from it?
4. what coupling will this boundary reduce or accidentally create?

That keeps the boundary tied to responsibility.

## Simple example

Suppose one service manages billing and another manages user profiles.

If billing starts depending on profile internals and profile starts knowing billing rules, the split stops helping.

A cleaner design lets billing own invoices, plans, and payment rules while profile owns user presentation and identity details.

## Common mistakes

- splitting services by team preference instead of domain ownership
- exposing internal details through the API contract
- creating boundaries that still require constant cross-service coordination
- adding services before a real ownership problem exists

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer wants the boundary to reduce confusion:

> I want each service to own a clear capability, protect its own rules, and expose the smallest contract the rest of the system needs.

That is usually more valuable than splitting for the sake of splitting.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you think about ownership, not only endpoints
- you understand contracts and invariants
- you can explain why a boundary helps the system stay clearer over time

That is stronger than saying "I would make this a microservice."

> Good boundaries reduce accidental coupling instead of renaming it.

> If the contract is fuzzy, the service boundary probably is too.
