## The trap

A lot of bad solutions start the same way: someone begins coding before the problem is even shaped.

You see a messy ticket or an interview prompt, your brain latches onto the first implementation idea, and suddenly you are solving a version of the problem that nobody actually confirmed.

That is how confusion turns into code.

## Mental model

Before a problem needs implementation, it usually needs structure.

Start by naming four things:

- what goes in
- what must come out
- what cannot break
- what is still unclear

That alone forces the problem to become more concrete.

You are no longer reacting to a vague prompt. You are defining the shape of the work.

## Break the problem down before you solve it

A simple sequence is:

1. restate the problem in plain language
2. separate inputs, outputs, and constraints
3. identify the biggest unknown
4. reduce the scope to the smallest useful version

This is not about sounding smart.

It is about removing ambiguity early, while it is still cheap.

Because once ambiguity turns into code, it gets harder to spot and more expensive to undo.

## Simple example

Imagine the prompt is:

> Build an endpoint to return the top 10 customers by revenue.

A weak start sounds like this:

> I probably just need a sorted query.

That sounds fast, but it skips the real work.

A stronger start looks more like this:

- input: date range, tenant, filters
- output: top 10 customers with revenue totals
- constraints: accuracy matters, latency matters, ties need a rule
- failure modes: missing data, incomplete filters, expensive query

Now the problem is smaller.

More importantly, it is clearer.

And once the shape is clear, the implementation becomes easier to trust.

## Common mistakes

Some patterns show up again and again:

- starting implementation before the problem is defined
- treating unclear requirements like permission to guess
- ignoring constraints until they break the solution later
- solving extra problems nobody asked for

Most of these are not coding mistakes.

They are framing mistakes.

## Weak answer vs strong answer

A weaker engineer often tries to prove speed.

A stronger engineer tries to prove control.

Weak version:

> I think I can code this quickly with a query and some sorting.

Stronger version:

> Before I implement this, I want to lock the input, output, and main constraints so I know I am solving the right version of the problem.

That second answer sounds slower.

In practice, it is usually faster.

Because it avoids building the wrong thing first.

## How a senior thinks

Senior engineers are not impressive because they rush.

They are impressive because they reduce the chance of wasted effort.

They know that a vague problem is dangerous, not because it is hard, but because it invites false confidence.

So instead of racing into code, they shape the problem first.

They get clear on what matters.
They expose uncertainty early.
They narrow the work before expanding the solution.

That is not hesitation.

That is control.

## What the interviewer usually wants to see

In interviews, people often think they are being judged on speed.

Usually they are being judged on clarity.

Interviewers want to see that you can:

- understand the problem
- reduce ambiguity
- make reasonable assumptions visible
- explain your thinking without getting lost

If you break the problem down calmly before coding, you already signal stronger judgment than someone who rushes into syntax.

> Do not solve everything at once. Shape the problem first, then choose the implementation.

👉 Direct takeaway

If you still cannot define the input, output, and main constraint, you are probably not ready to code yet.
