## The problem

Many security failures do not start with advanced attacks.

They start with a simple wrong assumption:

the system treated something as trustworthy too early.

That could be user input, a weakly validated token, data from the client, or a response from another service.

## Mental model

Security gets clearer when you think in trust boundaries.

That means asking where data moves from an untrusted environment into a place where it can cause real impact.

The useful question is:

> What am I accepting as true here, and why do I believe it?

## Breaking it down

A simple way to map trust boundaries is:

1. identify where the data comes from
2. see who could change it before it arrives
3. identify what the system does with it
4. validate or reduce permission before the impact point

That turns security into a concrete flow instead of an abstract theme.

## Simple example

Imagine a client sends this payload:

```json
{
  "userId": "123",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

If the backend uses that `role` as truth without validating it on the server, the trust boundary is broken.

The issue is not the JSON itself.

The issue is treating client-provided data as if it had authority over permissions.

## Common mistakes

- trusting client data without server validation
- assuming an internal service always responds correctly
- mixing identity with permission
- thinking about security only after the feature is already done

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer does not start with tools.

They start with trust flow:

> Before I decide the protection, I want to know where the system exchanges data with an untrusted environment and where that can turn into real impact.

That mindset prevents a lot of basic vulnerabilities.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you understand that security starts with trust modeling
- you can locate validation points
- you think about real impact, not only terminology

That sounds much stronger than checklist theater.

> Security starts when you stop assuming trust for convenience.

> If the system cannot explain why it believes a value, it is probably trusting too early.
