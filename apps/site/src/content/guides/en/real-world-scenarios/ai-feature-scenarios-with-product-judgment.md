description: How to think about AI features in real products without treating the model like a magic box that solves the product by itself.

## The problem

Many AI features begin with "let's add a model" before the team defines what part of the product actually improves because of it.

People talk about prompts, providers, and latency before deciding what success means, which failure is tolerable, and what fallback keeps the experience trustworthy.

Without that framing, the feature grows fragile.

## Mental model

An AI feature is not only a technical integration.

It is a probabilistic system inside a real product.

The useful question is:

> What does this AI need to get right, what is it allowed to get wrong, and how does the product stay usable when it fails?

That changes the conversation at the root.

## Breaking it down

A simple way to structure the scenario is:

1. define the real task the AI is supporting
2. say which error is most dangerous for the product
3. choose how to evaluate quality and cost
4. design fallback or human review where needed

That pulls the feature toward reliability, not only demo value.

## Simple example

Imagine a feature that summarizes support tickets.

A shallow answer is:

> I would add a model and store the summary.

A stronger answer is:

> I want to measure whether the summary preserves pending action, priority, and customer context. If confidence drops or cost rises too far, the system should show the original ticket and avoid blind automation.

Now there is product thinking, not just integration.

## Common mistakes

- treating average quality as enough for critical cases
- ignoring fallback when the model fails
- talking about prompts before defining evaluation
- forgetting cost, latency, and operational review

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer does not fall in love with the model capability.

They frame the real usefulness of the feature:

> Before I scale this feature, I want to know which error harms the product most, how quality will be measured, and what happens when the model answer is not good enough.

That keeps the feature grounded.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you think about AI as part of product behavior, not as a trick
- you connect quality to evaluation and fallback
- you consider cost, latency, and operations together with architecture

That looks like someone who can ship AI in production without losing judgment.

> A good AI feature does not rely only on the model being right. It relies on the system staying trustworthy when the model is not.

> If there is no fallback, the confidence in the feature is probably higher than it should be.
