## The problem

API scaling conversations often start at the architecture layer instead of the workload layer.

Teams talk about gateways, sharding, queues, and microservices before they can say which request path is actually under pressure.

## Mental model

A scalable API is not just an API with more infrastructure around it.

It is an API whose limits, traffic shape, and failure points are understood clearly enough to design around them.

The useful question is:

> Which part of this request path becomes too expensive or fragile first as traffic grows?

## Breaking it down

When thinking about a scaling scenario, ask:

1. what is the request pattern and traffic distribution?
2. where does latency or cost accumulate first?
3. which dependency is least able to scale with the rest?
4. what change would move the real limit instead of only adding complexity?

That makes the scenario concrete.

## Simple example

Suppose a popular endpoint reads from multiple services and one slow dependency dominates the latency.

The first scaling move may be caching, denormalized data, or a contract change.

It may not be splitting the API into more services at all.

The stronger answer starts from the stressed path, not the most fashionable architecture move.

## Common mistakes

- jumping to distributed patterns before naming the bottleneck
- treating "high traffic" as enough diagnosis
- scaling stateless layers while the database or dependency is still the real limit
- ignoring failure behavior while chasing throughput

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer wants the path under load to become explicit:

> I want to know which part of this API gets expensive first and what design change would actually move that limit.

That produces a better architecture conversation.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can connect scaling decisions to the request path
- you understand that not every bottleneck is solved the same way
- you think about resilience and cost together with throughput

That is stronger than a big-system checklist.

> A scalable API answer gets better when the stressed path gets specific.

> If the bottleneck is still unnamed, the architecture answer is still early.
