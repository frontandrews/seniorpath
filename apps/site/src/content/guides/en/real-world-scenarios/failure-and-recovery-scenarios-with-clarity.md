title: Failure and Recovery Scenarios With Clarity
description: How to reason about degraded states, partial outages, and recovery paths without pretending resilience is only about uptime.

## The problem

Teams often talk about resilience as if the goal were only "never fail."

Real systems still fail. The real quality question is how they fail, what keeps working, and how recovery happens.

## Mental model

Failure planning is product thinking, not only infrastructure thinking.

The useful question is:

> If this part breaks, what experience do users get, what should degrade gracefully, and how do we return to a healthy state?

That makes resilience more practical.

## Breaking it down

When modeling failure and recovery, ask:

1. which dependency or path can fail here?
2. what is the user-visible impact?
3. what degraded mode is acceptable?
4. how will the system recover or reconcile after the failure passes?

Those questions turn reliability into decisions instead of slogans.

## Simple example

Imagine a checkout flow depends on an external fraud service.

If that service times out, the system may choose to queue the review, block high-risk cases, or temporarily allow low-risk purchases with tighter monitoring.

The better answer is the one that names the degraded mode and the recovery path, not the one that only says "add retries."

## Common mistakes

- treating every failure as an all-or-nothing outage
- adding retries without deciding the product behavior
- forgetting the recovery or reconciliation path
- optimizing for uptime metrics while users still get confusing outcomes

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer wants the degraded state to be intentional:

> I want to know what should keep working, what should stop, and how the system gets back to a trustworthy state after the failure.

That is what makes resilience usable.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can think beyond pure uptime
- you understand degraded behavior and recovery
- you connect resilience to user impact, not just infrastructure

That is stronger than generic reliability language.

> Strong resilience design includes the failure path and the recovery path, not only the happy path.

> If the system fails gracefully but cannot recover cleanly, the story is still incomplete.
