## The problem

Overengineering rarely starts as ego.

It often starts as a reasonable desire to prepare for the future.

The trouble is that the future stays hypothetical while the added complexity becomes real immediately.

## Mental model

Avoiding overengineering does not mean building carelessly.

It means separating:

- what the system needs now
- what the next likely change might require
- what is still speculation

The goal is to leave a clean path forward, not to build every future path today.

## Breaking it down

Before adding complexity "for later," ask:

1. what real requirement exists today?
2. what future change is actually likely, not just imaginable?
3. can I leave a clean extension point instead of building the full abstraction now?
4. what maintenance cost appears the moment I add this?

That makes the trade-off visible.

## Simple example

Suppose the product has one payment provider today.

Building a massive multi-provider framework on day one may feel prudent, but it also adds interfaces, indirection, and configuration long before the second provider exists.

A smaller design that keeps the payment logic localized may be the better move if it stays easy to extend later.

## Common mistakes

- solving speculative future cases as if they were current requirements
- adding abstractions before the repeated shape exists
- confusing "possible someday" with "likely soon"
- ignoring the maintenance cost of the flexibility you just added

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer protects simplicity on purpose:

> I want the current case to stay clear, and I want the next likely change to stay possible. I do not need to pay for every hypothetical future today.

That is a strong form of restraint.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can separate current need from speculation
- you understand the cost of premature flexibility
- you know how to leave room for change without building the whole future

That often looks more mature than ambitious design.

> Overengineering is expensive because the hypothetical benefit is later, but the complexity cost is now.

> Strong judgment often sounds like "not yet" instead of "let's build everything."
