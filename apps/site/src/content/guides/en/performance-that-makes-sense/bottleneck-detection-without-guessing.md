## The problem

When something feels slow, teams often jump straight to solutions.

They cache, memoize, paginate, parallelize, or refactor before proving which layer is actually causing the pain.

That wastes time and can make the system harder without making it faster.

## Mental model

A bottleneck is the thing limiting the result right now.

The useful question is:

> Which part of the path is actually saturating or waiting long enough to shape the user experience?

Until that is clear, optimization is mostly guesswork.

## Breaking it down

When performance feels bad, ask:

1. is the pain in network, CPU, rendering, storage, or a dependency?
2. what measurement shows the slow segment?
3. is the issue throughput, latency, or wasted work?
4. what change would move the limit if the diagnosis is right?

Those questions make the investigation concrete.

## Simple example

A dashboard may feel slow to load.

The cause could be:

- a slow API call
- too much JavaScript on first render
- excessive rerenders after the data arrives

Each of those needs a different fix, so "optimize the page" is still too vague.

## Common mistakes

- optimizing the layer you understand best instead of the layer that is slow
- relying on intuition without measurement
- calling all slowness a frontend issue or all slowness a backend issue
- assuming one fix improves every bottleneck

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer wants a measurable diagnosis first:

> I do not want the most plausible optimization. I want the one that moves the real limit.

That keeps the work grounded.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can frame performance as diagnosis first
- you know how to separate likely layers of slowness
- you understand that the right fix depends on the actual bottleneck

That is stronger than listing generic optimizations.

> Performance work starts when the bottleneck gets named clearly.

> If the slow layer is still fuzzy, the optimization plan is probably early.
