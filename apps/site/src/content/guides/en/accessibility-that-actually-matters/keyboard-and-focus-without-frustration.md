## The problem

Interfaces often feel fine with a mouse and break down as soon as someone depends on the keyboard.

Focus jumps unpredictably, interactive elements are skipped, or the visible focus indicator disappears completely.

## Mental model

Keyboard accessibility is not an optional layer.

It is part of the interaction model.

The useful question is:

> Can someone understand where focus is, move through the flow, and activate the right control without a mouse?

## Breaking it down

When building keyboard support, ask:

1. is the tab order logical?
2. is focus visible at every step?
3. does the interaction follow expected keyboard behavior?
4. where should focus go after dialogs, menus, or dynamic updates?

Those questions usually reveal the weak spots quickly.

## Simple example

Suppose a modal opens and focus stays behind the overlay on the page.

Even if the modal looks correct visually, keyboard users now have a broken interaction because the active context and the visible context no longer match.

Focus management is part of correctness, not just polish.

## Common mistakes

- removing focus styles because they look ugly
- making elements clickable but not keyboard reachable
- ignoring focus return after closing overlays
- testing only pointer interaction and assuming keyboard will work

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer designs for keyboard behavior from the start:

> I want the focus path to make sense before I call this interaction finished.

That mindset catches many issues earlier.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you think about keyboard flow, not just click flow
- you understand visible focus and focus management
- you see accessibility as part of interaction quality

That is stronger than only mentioning `tabIndex`.

> Keyboard support is not a bonus path. It is part of the main interaction contract.

> If focus becomes confusing, the UI is not finished yet.
