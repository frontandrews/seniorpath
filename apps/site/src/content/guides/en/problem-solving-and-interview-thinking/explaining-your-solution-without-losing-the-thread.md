description: A simple way to talk while solving a problem without turning the answer into a confusing monologue.

## The problem

Some people can solve the problem and still lose strength when they need to explain what they are doing.

They either say too little and leave gaps, or they say too much and turn the answer into noise.

## Mental model

Explaining the solution does not mean narrating every thought in your head.

It means showing only what helps the other person trust the decision.

In practice, that usually fits into three things:

- which path you chose
- what trade-off exists
- why that choice makes sense here

## Breaking it down

A simple structure is:

1. state the simplest version of the solution
2. name the cost of that version
3. explain why you would improve it or why you would stop there
4. keep the explanation close to the problem, not to theory

That helps you avoid silence on one side and endless talking on the other.

## Simple example

This answer says very little:

> I would use two pointers.

A stronger version is:

> I can sort the array and use two pointers to look for the target sum. The cost is paying for the sort and losing the original order. If I needed one pass or had to preserve order, I would move to a hash map.

Now the interviewer can see path, cost, and decision criteria.

## Common mistakes

- describing technical detail before stating the main idea
- saying the technique name as if that explained everything
- hiding the trade-off to make the answer sound obvious
- talking about theory for too long and never landing on a concrete decision

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer explains to build trust, not to perform.

That usually sounds like:

> My simplest correct version is this. The cost is this. If I needed to improve it, I would go in this direction for this reason.

That is enough to make the path visible.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can structure the answer
- you understand the cost of your own choice
- you can communicate clearly without improvising forever

That often looks more mature than trying to sound brilliant in every sentence.

> Explaining well is not talking a lot. It is making clear why your decision makes sense.

> If the other person cannot follow your path, the solution may be correct, but the answer is still weak.
