## The problem

Many interview mistakes happen before the code starts.

The candidate recognizes a pattern too early and answers a question that feels close, but is not actually the one being asked.

## Mental model

Thinking before you code is not stalling. It is how you show control.

The simple model is:

- understand the problem
- name the first correct solution
- improve only when there is a reason

That keeps optimization from showing up before understanding.

## Breaking it down

A safe sequence is:

1. restate the prompt in your own words
2. confirm inputs, outputs, and edge cases
3. name the simplest correct approach
4. explain the trade-off
5. optimize only if needed

This sequence keeps you from solving the wrong problem by accident.

## Simple example

Suppose the prompt is:

> Find the first repeated number in an array.

Instead of jumping straight to a hash map, say:

> The brute-force version compares each number with the values after it. That is easy to trust, but it is O(n²). If I need linear time, I would track seen values in a set and return the first number I encounter twice.

Now the interviewer can see your reasoning, not just your final code.

## Common mistakes

- jumping to the optimized pattern before proving you understood the prompt
- hiding your reasoning because you want to look fast
- forgetting edge cases like empty input or no repeated value
- explaining theory forever and never landing on a decision

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer knows that trust matters more than theatrics.

They make the path visible:

> Here is the simplest correct version. Here is the trade-off. Here is how I would improve it if needed.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Most interviewers are looking for a few direct signals:

- you understood the problem
- you can choose a sensible trade-off
- you can explain your decision clearly

That is why thinking before coding usually scores better than sounding fast.

> In interviews, clarity beats speed more often than people think. First prove you understood the problem, then improve the solution.

> If you have not explained the simplest correct version yet, you are probably optimizing too early.
