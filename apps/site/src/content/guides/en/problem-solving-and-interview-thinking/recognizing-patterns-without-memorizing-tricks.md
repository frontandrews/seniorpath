## The problem

Many people study interviews as if there were an endless catalog of tricks to memorize.

That usually goes badly.

You may recognize the name of a pattern and still not know why it fits the problem.

## Mental model

A pattern is not a ready-made answer.

It is a recurring way to organize the problem.

Instead of asking "which trick solves this?", the better question is:

> What kind of structure is this problem asking for?

## Breaking it down

A simple way to recognize patterns is to notice:

1. what needs to be found, compared, or grouped
2. whether order matters
3. whether you need to remember what you already saw
4. whether the solution improves when repeated work gets reduced

Those signals usually help more than the fancy technique name.

## Simple example

Imagine the prompt is:

> Given an array of numbers, return `true` if any pair adds up to a target value.

You could compare every pair.

But the real structure is:

- walk through a collection
- remember what already appeared
- answer quickly when you find the complement

That shape points toward a set or hash map, not because it is a famous pattern, but because the problem asks for fast lookup memory.

## Common mistakes

- forcing the problem into the first famous pattern that comes to mind
- memorizing the technique name without understanding the signal behind it
- skipping the simple version too early
- acting like recognizing a pattern replaces explaining your reasoning

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer does not stop at naming the pattern.

They explain why it appeared:

> I need to know quickly whether I have seen a related value before, so a fast lookup structure makes sense here.

That is much stronger than only saying "this is a hash map problem."

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers want a few clear signals:

- you can see the shape of the problem
- you can choose a coherent structure
- you can justify why that structure makes sense

That looks much more trustworthy than reciting memorized tricks.

> Recognizing a pattern is not remembering a technique name. It is seeing which structure solves the problem with less friction.

> If you cannot explain why the pattern fits, you probably only memorized the answer.
