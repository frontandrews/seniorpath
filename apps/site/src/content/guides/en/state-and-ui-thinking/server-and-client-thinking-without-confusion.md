## The problem

Modern frontend systems make it easy to blur server and client responsibilities until the architecture starts feeling random.

Then data fetching, interactivity, and rendering cost get mixed together, and the boundaries stop helping.

## Mental model

The useful question is not "what can run on the server?" or "what can run on the client?"

It is:

> Which side should own this work so the system stays simpler, faster, and easier to reason about?

Server and client are different tools, not identity labels.

## Breaking it down

When deciding where work belongs, ask:

1. does this need access to the database, secrets, or private APIs?
2. does it depend on direct user interaction or browser APIs?
3. does moving it earlier reduce data transfer or render work?
4. who should own the source of truth for this step?

Those questions keep the boundary tied to purpose.

## Simple example

Rendering a product page with server-fetched data is usually a server concern.

Managing a local filter panel, input focus, or optimistic button state is usually a client concern.

Confusion starts when you move everything to one side just because the framework allows it.

## Common mistakes

- moving logic to the client by default when the server could simplify it
- pushing interactive state to the server when the browser should own it
- treating server and client like opposing camps
- drawing boundaries without a concrete reason behind them

## How a senior thinks

A senior engineer makes the boundary serve the system:

> I want data loading and private work where they stay cheap and trustworthy. I want interaction where it stays responsive and local.

That produces cleaner decisions than framework slogans.

## What the interviewer wants to see

Interviewers usually want to know:

- you can explain why work belongs on one side or the other
- you understand the cost of moving work across the boundary
- you are thinking about ownership, latency, and complexity together

That is much stronger than naming framework features.

> Server and client boundaries are useful only when they make the system simpler.

> If you cannot explain why the work lives there, the boundary is probably not helping.
